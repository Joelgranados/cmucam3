Welcome
=======

To build the cc3 system, you need GNU Make and a version of GCC.  The
system is split into 2 main parts, "hal" and "projects".

Inside the hal directory are more directories, one each for a
particular kind of hardware.

Currently, there is only one hal.


Compiler
========

The compiler choice is left up to the hal. This allows different hardware
platforms to use different compilers.

Currently, the only supported hal is "lpc2106-cmucam3", which uses a
version of GCC optimized for the ARM processor. To build using this
hal, you'll need the arm-none-eabi-* style GCC tools from
CodeSourcery.  These can be acquired here:

Get the "EABI" or "Bare Metal" target.


If you feel like using a different compiler, simply change the
variables in hal/lpc2106-cmucam3/defs.mk to something else. A popular
thing to change is COMPILER_PREFIX, in case you have a custom compiler
built under a different name.


Building
========

Once you have the compiler, you need to build the system. From the top
level, invoking make will build all the hal libraries, and will build
a subset of items in the "projects" directory. 

Changing SUBDIRS in projects/Makefile will change which projects are
built. Changing SUBDIRS in hal/Makefile will change which hals are
built.

Invoking make directly from a particular project or hal directory will
build that directory, regardless of SUBDIRS.
