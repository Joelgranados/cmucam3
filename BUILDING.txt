To build the cc3 system, you need GNU Make and a version of GCC.  The
system is split into 2 main parts, "hal" and "projects".

Inside the hal directory are directories, one each for a particular
kind of hardware.

Currently, the only supported hal is "lpc2106-cmucam3". To build using
this hal, you'll need the arm-none-eabi-* style GCC tools from CodeSourcery.
These can be acquired here:

Get the "EABI" or "Bare Metal" target. 

If you feel like using a different compiler, simply change the
variables in hal/lpc2106-cmucam3/defs.mk to something else. A popular
thing to change is COMPILER_PREFIX, in case you have a custom compiler
built under a different name.


Once you have the compiler, you need to build the system. From the top level,
invoking make will build all the hal libraries, and will build a subset
of items in the "projects" directory. Changing SUBDIRS in projects/Makefile
will change the default projects built. Invoking make in a particular
project or hal directory will unconditionally build that directory.
